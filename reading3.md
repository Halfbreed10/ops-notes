Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process? I would say it is similar to warming up before playing basketball. Youll try to get loose and stretch to make sure you are ready to go. If there are in issues with the warmup youll shut down until you can figure out the problem before you play.

What is the “Power On Self Test”? Its a self test that checks the computer systems internal hardware components for compatability, connection, and ensures no errors exist before loading the operating system.

What is the CMOS? CMOS stands for "Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor" and is a type of technology used to produce intergrated circuits. In computer architecure CMOS is used to store critcal data used by the operating systems during the booting process.
