Build a computer

-Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need? It depends on what youre using your computer for. The typical computer only needs about 6 cores, if you want more speed for gaming etc. then you would use a CPU with a higher core count.
-What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor? First you're going to look to make sure the CPU is compatible with the motherboard by checking the socket. Next you want top check for onboard Wifi, Bluetooth, multiple RAM slots/high RAM capacity, and support for graphics cards.
-What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device? You'll have to decide if you want HDD or SSD. Some of the trade offs you'd evaluate are SSDs are much faster than traditional HDDs, and contain no moving parts. Also, an SSD either comes as a standalone drive or an M.2 drive, which slots directly into your motherboard. SSDs are much faster, however much more pricey.  
-Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with? For someone with a similar background as me I would definitley give them the hands on approach. I would take pieces out and let them see and touch the components as I explain what they are and how they work. 

## Things I want to know more about

- The difference in processors and how to install a better one without frying the computer.
