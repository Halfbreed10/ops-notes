What is an ISO file?:
It is important to understand what ISO files are and how they are made because we downloaded our own and programed or lab computers with it.

What is an ISO File? An ISO file, often called an ISO image, is a single file that's a perfect representation of an entire CD, DVD, or BD.

How do you write an ISO file to a CD, DVD, or removable media (like a thumb drive)? The most common way to make use of an ISO file is to burn it to a CD, DVD, or BD disc. This is a different process than burning music or document files to a disc because your CD/DVD/BD burning software must "assemble" the contents of the ISO file onto the disc.

How do you create an ISO file? Several programs let you create your own ISO file from a disc or a collection of files you've chosen, such as ISO workshop, Power ISO, and DVD ISO maker.

How do you mount an ISO file? Mounting an ISO file is usually as simple as opening the file with something called a "disc emulator" and then choosing a drive letter that the ISO file should represent. Even though this drive letter is a virtual drive, Windows sees it as a real one, and you can use it as such, too.
