### Reading #1

The topic of hardware hacking is important to this module because we are learning about the hardware of computers. We are also learning how to break down and assemble computers, upgrade computers, and understranding the components of computers.

1-How is a hardware hack different than a software hack? A hardware hack is different from a software hack because the hacker would need to physically present in order to alter the targeted device in order to pull of the hack.
2-What are the two ways for spies to alter a computer’s hardware? Two ways for spies to alter a computers hardware is interdiction, which consists of manipulating devices as they are in transit from manufacturer to customer. The second way involves seeding changes from the very beginning, such as developing a deep understanding of a product’s design, manipulating components at the factory, and ensuring that the doctored devices made it through the global logistics chain to the desired location.
3-Explain how the hack worked. The hack worked becuase they really took their time in understanding what was being used the most by the compaines in the United States and the need to keep up with technology. Also, the chip was so small and designed to be as inconspicious as possible, and it they didnt look like microchips which made them go undetected. 
4-How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source? Incestigators were able to trace back to the source because since it is a hardware hack, it leaves a trail. There would shipping invoices, shipping manifests, serial numbers etc. U.S. Intelligence were able to retrace Supermicros supply chain back to three main manufactor companies based in Taiwan and Shanghai.
